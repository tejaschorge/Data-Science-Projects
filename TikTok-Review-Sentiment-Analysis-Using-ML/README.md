# ðŸŽµ TikTok Review Sentiment Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline designed to extract insights from user-generated TikTok content using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. The system processes thousands of user comments to determine their underlying sentimentâ€”Positive, Negative, or Neutral, using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library. Extensive text preprocessing is applied, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and stemming, to ensure clean input for sentiment classification.

The cleaned and analyzed data is visualized using advanced plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly, offering intuitive representations such as sentiment-specific word clouds and interactive pie charts. The project also includes logic to assess the overall mood of the dataset based on cumulative sentiment scores. This solution helps in understanding public opinion on TikTok content, making it valuable for creators, influencers, and marketers aiming to measure engagement and audience perception at scale.

**Key features include:**

  - Text preprocessing using regular expressions, NLTK stopwords, and stemming

  - Sentiment classification using VADER's compound scoring system

  - Visual insights via word clouds and sentiment distribution pie charts

  - Aggregated sentiment interpretation to determine overall audience tone

  - Applicable to any short-form content platform, especially TikTok
